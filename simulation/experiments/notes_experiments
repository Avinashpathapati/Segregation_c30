New Experiment paramters: 

Building Exerpiment:
epochs, dim, density, homophily, ageing, reproduction, radius, playback_speed = \
    500,    20,  0.5,    2,         10,      0.1,         2,      100

Babyboom: 
Scenario 1: 
epochs, dim, density, homophily, ageing, reproduction, radius, playback_speed = \
    500,    20,  0.5,    2,         10,      0.1,         2,      100

Epoch 50: reproduction = 0.8
Epoch 60: reproduction = 0.1

Grid is relatively empty, then a lot of young agents spawn so its a sea of green. Then they all slowly become blue, then red and then they all die and
the level of agents resets to roughly the previos level. 


Scenario 2: 
    epochs, dim, density, homophily, ageing, reproduction, radius, playback_speed = \
    500,    20,  0.25,    2,         4,      0.25,         2,      10

Epoch 50: reproduction = 0.85
Epoch 60: reproduction = 0.1
Epoch 75: reproduction = 0.


Is equilbirum possible?
 epochs, dim, density, homophily, ageing, reproduction, radius, playback_speed = \
    500,    20,  0.5,    2,         10,      0.1,         2,      10




Density is no longer important!!
