## Running this software
### Preparations
Please create a virtual environment in which python version 3.7.4 is used. Once that environment is active, clone this repository and navigate to `Segregation_c30/`. Now run the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Start  it
Navigate to the `simulation/` folder and run the `visualization.py` file:
```
cd simulation/
python visualization.py
```
In the terminal a list of completed epochs is shown. Once the set number of epochs has passed a window will open, which will show a replay of what happened.

### Stop it
To close or exit this program at any point, use `CTRL+C` in the terminal.
