# Design of Multi-Agents Systems

## Running this software
### Preparations
Please create a virtual environment in which python version 3.7.4 is used. Once that environment is active, clone this repository and use the following commands:
```
cd Segregation_c30/
git checkout development
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Start it
Navigate to the `simulation/` folder and run the `visualization.py` file:
```
cd simulation/
python visualization.py
```
Once the program is started, it will ask for some parameters. Press the `Enter`-key in order to proceed and use the defaults. Now, a control panel will open. Here, one can print useful information to the terminal, generate plots, and start/stop the replay of the simulation.

### Stop it
To close or exit this program at any point, use the `Exit Program` button or `CTRL+C` in the terminal.
